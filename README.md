Genshin1-ai

Why did I choose this theme?
- I choose this theme because I want to play this Genshin Impact and I want to experience how's the quality of the game or is this better than any of the game

What is this Chatbot?
- This ChatBot is created by Justin Miguel L. De Paz, Genshin1.AI is a specialized, persona-driven artificial intelligence interface.
-  Unlike a standard chatbot (like a plain ChatGPT window), it is a themed "System Interface" that bridges the gap between the lore of Genshin Impact and the power of Large Language Models (specifically Google Gemini Pro).
It is designed to look and feel like a high-tech terminal found within the game's world—combining aesthetics from the Akasha System and ancient Khaenri'ah technology.


Key Benefits for the User
Why would someone use Genshin1.AI?
1. Immersive Roleplay & Fandom Interaction
Fans of the game often want to interact with their favorite characters in a way that feels "in-universe."
Aether/Lumine: Users can talk to the Travelers as if they are checking in on their journey.
Furina: Users can enjoy her flamboyant, theatrical personality while asking for help.
The UI/UX (the glitch effects, background transitions, and scanlines) makes the user feel like they are actually operating a terminal in Teyvat.
2. Specialized Game Assistant (The "Archives")
Instead of searching a wiki, a user can use this AI to ask hyper-specific questions about the game.
"What is the history of the Guizhong Ballista?"
"Can you suggest a team comp for Furina using only F2P characters?"
Because it uses Gemini Pro, it can process complex logic better than a simple search engine.
3. Creative Writing and "Musing"
The "Creative" mode in your sidebar is perfect for fan-fiction writers or theory-crafters.
A writer might use the Lumine persona to help brainstorm a strategic battle scene.
A player might use the Furina persona to write a dramatic script for a community event.
4. A Aesthetic Productivity Tool
Some people find standard AI interfaces (like ChatGPT or Claude) to be boring or "too corporate."
Genshin1.AI offers a "Program" mode and "Email" mode. This allows a developer or a student to do their actual work (coding, writing emails) inside a high-quality, beautiful interface that reflects their hobby.

and for what is this chatbot?
This chatbot is for Genshin Impact fans who want a high-tech, lore-accurate, and character-driven way to interact with AI for both gaming help and creative inspiration.



How to use this chatbot (Manual)
Phase 1: Initiation (The Landing Page)
Enter the Core: On the main screen, click "Play" or "Start Sync." This triggers the fade-in of the AI-SYSTEM.
About the Tech: Click "About" to read the background lore and technical specs of the Unit_02 interface.

Phase 2: Personnel Selection (The Sidebar)
The personality and look of the AI change based on who you choose.
Aether (The Stoic): Choose him for helpful, polite, and protective assistance. He is best for general questions.
Lumine (The Analyst): Choose her for direct, strategic, and analytical answers. She is best for complex lore or logic.
Furina (The Director): Choose her for dramatic, creative, and expressive conversations. She is best for storytelling or brainstorming.

Phase 3: Choosing your "Communication Mode"
In the sidebar, you can set the "Context" for the AI:
Message: Standard conversation.
Email: Use this when you want the AI to help you write professional or formal text.
Program: Best for coding or solving math/logic problems.
Creative: Removes "stiffness" and allows the AI to use imagination for roleplay or fan fiction.

Phase 4: Interacting via Chat
Typing: Locate the input bar at the bottom. It will say "Speak to Aether..." (or whichever character is active).
Sending: Type your query and hit Enter or click the Send icon.
Synchronization: Watch the "Syncing Neural Paths" pulse. This means Gemini Pro is processing your request in the cloud.
The Output: The message will appear with a "Typewriter" effect, simulating a real-time data stream from Teyvat.

Phase 5: Using "Terminal Commands" (The Pro Way)
Instead of just chatting, you can "override" the system by typing commands into the chat bar. Try these:
/archives: This triggers a system response showing you Lore Fragments (like the Fall of Khaenri'ah).
/system: This displays the current technical status of the Gemini Node and Sync Efficiency.
/clear: Use this to wipe the current chat history and reset the terminal buffer.

Phase 6: Navigation & Gestures
Mobile Users: Swipe your finger from the left edge of the screen to pull out the Sidebar menu. To hide it, swipe it back or tap the dark background.
Desktop Users: Use the Chevron (Arrow) button on the left to toggle the sidebar.
Going Home: Click the Home (House) icon at the top of the sidebar to exit the AI and return to the main landing page.
